# 🎲 Tic Tac Toe

A browser-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented with modular JavaScript and a “no globals” architecture. Practice organizing game logic into discrete objects, handling win/tie detection, and rendering/updating the UI dynamically.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Gameboard Module**  
  - Stores board state as an array  
  - Exposes methods to read/update cells  
- **Player Factory**  
  - Creates player objects with `name`, `marker` (“X” or “O”), and turn order  
- **Game Controller Module**  
  - Manages turn flow, win/tie detection (all 3‑in‑a‑row combinations), and game reset  
- **Display Controller Module**  
  - Renders board array to the DOM  
  - Listens for cell clicks, preventing plays on occupied cells  
  - Updates UI to show current player’s turn and end‑of‑game messages  
- **Modular Architecture** using ES6 factories and IIFEs to avoid polluting the global scope :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Designing **self‑contained modules** with minimal global code  
- Using **factory functions** and **IIFEs (module pattern)** to encapsulate state :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Implementing **win/tie detection** by checking all possible index triplets  
- Dynamically **rendering** and **updating** the DOM based on an underlying data array  
- Managing **event listeners** for interactive game play  
- Structuring code for **separation of concerns** (game logic vs. display logic)

## 📚 Assignment Summary
From The Odin Project’s JavaScript curriculum:
1. Initialize a Git repo with HTML, CSS, and JS scaffold.  
2. Build a **Gameboard** object (array-based) and **Player** objects.  
3. Develop a **Game Controller** to:
   - Play turns in the console first  
   - Detect wins (three in a row) and ties  
4. Create a **Display Controller** to:
   - Render the board array to the page  
   - Handle user clicks, names input, and a restart button  
   - Display end‑of‑game notifications (win/tie)  
5. Keep global scope clean by using ES6 modules and IIFE-wrapped factories.
